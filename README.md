## Quebec's Covid data
The graphs we usually see with just the cases can give the impression that things are getting worse, each wave getting bigger than the previous one. 
Adding deaths (dot colors) and CFR tells a completely different story. At the beggining of the pandemic we had more that 1/8th of the cases ending in death, and now it's less that 1/500th. This is us getting better at detecting covid cases, protecting and treating the vulnerable, and vaccinating. It's not over yet, but it looks like we are on the right track.
