# DataScience
Fun with data, while learning Python, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit, TensorFlow & more.

## Dog breed identification from a photo
This was part of the "[Complete ML & Data Science bootcamp 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-zero-to-mastery/learn/lecture/18041737#overview)", with a dataset of 10K labelled dog images + 10K unlabelled test images from Kaggle. We use TensorFlow 2.0 to train a Deep Learning model using Transfer Learning. [Google colab project](https://github.com/BenoitFries/DataScience/blob/main/dog_vision.ipynb).

## Animated GIS Map of Canada and the US
I wanted to try GeoPandas, so I created a map by combining two different GIS sources, and added a layer with drought data over it.

## Quebec's Covid data
The graphs we usually see with just the cases can give the impression that things are getting worse, each wave getting bigger than the previous one. 
Adding deaths (dot colors) and CFR (red line) tells a different story. At the beggining of the pandemic we had more that 1/8th of the cases ending in death, and now it's less that 1/500th. This is us getting better at detecting covid cases, protecting and treating the vulnerable, and vaccinating.
